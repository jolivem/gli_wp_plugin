== Why to have a Image Gallery in your website? ==

It is not a secret that images are one of the best and most effective ways to attract people. They are catchy, colorful, bright. Even a text on an image appears to be more attention-grabbing than just a text on a website. Images speak to our emotions, imagination and our unconscious part as well. Image presence in a website make it more social as it takes a few seconds for the human brain to process an image, which is considerably faster than processing content or text. 
Whether you specialize in **photography**, **creative design**, **journalism** or you are a **travel blogger**, your photos tell a unique story and deserve to be presented in the best possible way. And our friendly and feature rich Photo Gallery plugin will help you with that! Here, you can create your own single and multiple free galleries from your photo library. We offer a **responsive Lightbox Gallery plugin**. So you will give thorough information about your portfolio.
Adding an image gallery page to your website helps with:

* Attracting potential customers – As already mentioned images and photos grab attention, add engagement and give a boost in pageviews.
* Generating more sales – Photo Galleries give more information about your work and affect the final purchase decision.
